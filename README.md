For this Python project (PyBank and PyPoll). PyBank: main.py looks at a csv file in the Resources folder and provides a financial analysis of the profit/loss of a company over a series of months, returning which was the month with the greatest increase in profits over the time period, the month with the greatest decrease in profits, as well as the total profit/loss and the average over the series. This is then output into a text file in the analysis folder for PyBank. PyPoll: main.py looks at a csv file in the Resources folder and provides a summary of votes in an election. The data returned includes each candidate voted for and their total/percentage of the votes earned, the total votes received overall, and declares a winner of the election. This is then output into a text file in the analysis folder for PyPoll.
