# Python Project: PyBank and PyPoll
This repository contains two Python projects: PyBank and PyPoll.

# PyBank
The PyBank project analyzes financial data of a company over a series of months. The main.py script reads a CSV file located in the Resources folder and performs a comprehensive financial analysis. It identifies the month with the greatest increase in profits, the month with the greatest decrease in profits, calculates the total profit/loss over the entire period, and determines the average profit/loss. The results of the analysis are then saved in a text file located in the analysis folder for PyBank.

# PyPoll
The PyPoll project focuses on summarizing election data. The main.py script reads a CSV file located in the Resources folder and provides a detailed summary of the votes cast in an election. It identifies each candidate who received votes, calculates their total number of votes and the percentage of votes they earned. Additionally, it determines the total number of votes cast overall and declares the winner of the election. The summary of the election results is saved in a text file located in the analysis folder for PyPoll.

Please refer to the individual project folders for detailed instructions on how to run and utilize the PyBank and PyPoll scripts effectively.
